If you have a Minolta PagePro 1200W printer and want to use it on your Windows 7 64-bit computer, you may encounter some difficulties finding and installing the right driver. This is because this printer model is no longer supported by Konica Minolta, the manufacturer of Minolta printers, and the official driver download center does not offer any drivers for Windows 7 64-bit[^1^]. However, there are some alternative ways to get your printer working on your computer. Here are some steps you can try:

1. Check if your printer is compatible with Windows 7 64-bit. According to some online sources[^2^] [^3^], the Minolta PagePro 1200W printer can work on Windows 7 64-bit using the generic PCL5 or PCL6 driver that comes with Windows. To do this, you need to connect your printer to your computer using a USB cable and turn it on. Then, go to **Control Panel** > **Devices and Printers** and click on **Add a printer**. Choose **Add a local printer** and select the port where your printer is connected. Click on **Next** and then choose **Generic** from the manufacturer list and **PCL5 or PCL6** from the printer list. Click on **Next** and follow the instructions to complete the installation.
2. If the generic driver does not work for you, you can try to use a compatible driver from another printer model. Some users have reported that they were able to use the driver for Konica Minolta PagePro 1250W or WeP Laser 1430 on their Minolta PagePro 1200W printer[^2^]. To do this, you need to download the driver from a third-party website[^2^] [^4^] and extract it to a folder on your computer. Then, follow the same steps as above but choose **Have Disk** instead of **Generic** when selecting the manufacturer and browse to the folder where you extracted the driver. Select the appropriate .inf file and click on **Open**. Then, choose the printer model that matches the driver you downloaded and click on **Next**. Follow the instructions to complete the installation.
3. If none of the above methods work for you, you may need to upgrade your printer or use a different operating system that supports your printer. Unfortunately, there is no official way to get a driver for Minolta PagePro 1200W printer on Windows 7 64-bit as Konica Minolta has discontinued this product and does not provide any updates or support for it[^1^]. You can contact Konica Minolta customer service for more information or check their website for other printer models that are compatible with Windows 7 64-bit.
