Iron Grip: Warlord is a tower defense game with first-person shooter elements that was released in 2008 by ISOTX. The game puts you in the role of a rebel leader who must fight off hordes of invaders in a steampunk-inspired world. You can play alone or with up to eight friends online or over LAN[^1^].
 
However, the game requires an activation code to register and play online, which is no longer available since the game's official website is down. If you want to play Iron Grip: Warlord without an activation code, you can follow these steps[^2^]:

1. Run the game at least once. You can try registering with an empty key in case the registry is not present.
2. Open regedit.exe and search for the following registry: Computer\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Isotx\IGWarlord
3. Double click LicenseInfo, right click the window, press select all and backspace. Save the value and start the game.

This method should trick the game's code into thinking that it is registered and allow you to play online. However, this may not work for everyone and it is not endorsed by the game's developers. Use it at your own risk.
