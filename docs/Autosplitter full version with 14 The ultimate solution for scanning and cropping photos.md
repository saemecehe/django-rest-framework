# Why You Should Avoid Cracked Versions of AutoSplitter
 
AutoSplitter is a software that allows you to scan multiple photos at once and crop them automatically. It is a useful tool for anyone who wants to digitize their old photo albums or create digital copies of their prints. However, some people may be tempted to download a cracked version of AutoSplitter instead of paying for the full version.
 
This is a bad idea for several reasons. First of all, software piracy is illegal and unethical. You are stealing from the developer who worked hard to create and maintain AutoSplitter. By buying the full version, you are supporting their business and helping them continue to improve the software. The full version of AutoSplitter costs only $19.95, which is a reasonable price for such a handy program.

Secondly, cracked versions of AutoSplitter may not work properly or may contain malware, spyware or viruses. You are putting your computer and your personal data at risk by downloading and installing unverified software from unknown sources. You may end up with corrupted files, slow performance, pop-up ads or worse. You also won't get any support or updates from the developer if you encounter any problems or bugs with the cracked version.

Thirdly, cracked versions of AutoSplitter may not have all the features and functions of the full version. For example, the full version of AutoSplitter has a feature called "14 mode", which allows you to scan 14 photos at once on a single A4 sheet. This can save you time and paper when scanning large batches of photos. The cracked versions may not have this feature or may have limited functionality.
 
Therefore, it is better to avoid cracked versions of AutoSplitter and buy the full version instead. You will get a reliable, safe and efficient software that can help you scan and crop your photos with ease. You will also get support, upgrades and peace of mind for that amount. AutoSplitter is created by a single developer who deserves your respect and appreciation for their work.
  
If you are wondering how to use AutoSplitter, it is very simple and intuitive. You just need to place your photos on a flatbed scanner and press the scan button. AutoSplitter will detect the edges of each photo and crop them automatically. You can also adjust the settings and preferences according to your needs. For example, you can choose the output format, resolution, quality and folder for your scanned photos. You can also rotate, flip or straighten your photos if needed.
 
AutoSplitter is compatible with most scanners and operating systems. It supports Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10. It also works with any TWAIN-compliant scanner, which means most scanners on the market. You can use AutoSplitter with any scanner that has a flatbed or a document feeder. However, if you use a document feeder, you may need to scan one photo at a time to avoid overlapping or jamming.
 
AutoSplitter is a great software for anyone who wants to preserve their memories and share them with others. You can use it to scan your old family photos, your childhood pictures, your travel snapshots or any other prints that you have. You can then store them on your computer, upload them to online platforms or print them again. You can also use AutoSplitter to create digital collages, scrapbooks or photo books with your scanned photos.
