To get a Hyperspin wheel pack, users need to download the media files from one of these sources and extract them to the appropriate folder in their Hyperspin directory. The folder structure may vary depending on the type of wheel pack, but generally it follows this pattern:

    Hyperspin
      Media
        Main Menu
          Images
            Wheel
              [Wheel Pack Files]
        [System Name]
          Images
            Wheel
              [Wheel Pack Files]

After copying the wheel pack files to the correct folder, users need to launch Hyperspin and enjoy their new look.
  
In this section, we will show you how to create your own custom wheel pack for Hyperspin using some simple tools and steps. This tutorial is based on the video by YouTube user colpipes1978[^1^], but you can also find other guides and resources on the HyperSpin forum[^2^] and other websites.
 
## Step 1: Prepare the tools and files
 
To create a custom wheel pack, you will need the following tools and files:

- [Art Tools](https://mega.nz/#!wjhwUYYQ!jvaJwblOe0...): This is a zip file that contains some useful programs and templates for creating wheel images. You will need to extract this file to a folder on your computer.
- [Hyperspin 1.5.1 Full Package](https://www.hyperspin-fe.com/files/file/17585-hyperspin-151-full-package/): This is the latest version of the Hyperspin front-end that you will need to install and run on your computer.
- [RocketLauncher Latest Version](https://www.hyperspin-fe.com/files/file/17586-rocketlauncher-latest-version/): This is a program that integrates with Hyperspin and allows you to launch games and emulators.
- [RocketLauncher Media Pack](https://www.hyperspin-fe.com/files/file/17587-rocketlauncher-media-pack/): This is a zip file that contains some media files for RocketLauncher, such as bezels, fades, pause menus, etc.
- [Main Menu Wheels](https://www.hyperspin-fe.com/files/category/1882-main-menu-wheels/): This is a section of the HyperSpin forum where you can download some existing wheel packs for the main menu of Hyperspin. You can use these as a reference or inspiration for your own wheel pack.
- [Wheel Packs](https://www.hyperspin-fe.com/files/category/404-wheel-packs/): This is another section of the HyperSpin forum where you can download some existing wheel packs for specific systems or categories. You can use these as a reference or inspiration for your own wheel pack.
- Games and Emulators: These are the games and emulators that you want to play on Hyperspin. You will need to find and download these files from other sources, as they are not provided by Hyperspin or RocketLauncher.

## Step 2: Create the wheel images
 
To create the wheel images, you will need to use one of the programs in the Art Tools folder. There are two options: Photoshop or Gimp. Photoshop is a professional image editing software that requires a license, while Gimp is a free and open source alternative. Both programs can open and edit PSD files, which are the templates for creating wheel images.
 
To create a wheel image, follow these steps:

1. Open Photoshop or Gimp and load one of the PSD files in the Art Tools folder. There are different templates for different types of wheels, such as bordered, framed, round, etc. Choose the one that suits your preference.
2. On the PSD file, you will see several layers that represent different elements of the wheel image, such as background, border, logo, etc. You can edit each layer by changing its color, size, position, opacity, etc.
3. To add a logo to your wheel image, you will need to find an image of the game or system that you want to represent. You can search online for logos or use one of the existing ones in the Art Tools folder. You will need to resize and crop the logo image to fit inside the wheel template.
4. To add a logo to your wheel image, drag and drop the logo image onto the PSD file. Then, move it to the appropriate layer and position it inside the wheel template. You can also adjust its opacity, brightness, contrast, etc. to make it look better.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each game or system that you want to include in your wheel pack. You can also create sub-wheels for genres or categories by using
