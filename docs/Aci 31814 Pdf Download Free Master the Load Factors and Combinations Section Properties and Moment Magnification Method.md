# ACI 318-14: Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete
 
ACI 318-14 is a comprehensive document that provides the minimum requirements for the design and construction of structural concrete members and systems. It covers topics such as materials, durability, analysis, design, construction, inspection, and testing of concrete structures. It also includes provisions for seismic design, fire resistance, anchoring, and post-tensioning.
 
The document is organized into 25 chapters and 10 appendices, covering various aspects of structural concrete design and construction. The document is intended to be used by engineers, architects, contractors, building officials, and others involved in the design and construction of concrete structures.

## ACI 318-14: Summary of Main Points
 
ACI 318-14 is a comprehensive document that provides the minimum requirements for the design and construction of structural concrete members and systems. It covers topics such as materials, durability, analysis, design, construction, inspection, and testing of concrete structures. It also includes provisions for seismic design, fire resistance, anchoring, and post-tensioning.
 
The document is organized into 25 chapters and 10 appendices, covering various aspects of structural concrete design and construction. The document is intended to be used by engineers, architects, contractors, building officials, and others involved in the design and construction of concrete structures.
 
Some of the main points of ACI 318-14 are summarized below:
 
- Chapter 1 defines the general requirements, purpose, applicability, interpretation, and roles of the building official and the licensed design professional. It also specifies the construction documents, testing and inspection, and approval of special systems or alternative materials.
- Chapter 2 defines the notation and terminology used in the document.
- Chapter 3 lists the referenced standards from other organizations such as AASHTO, ASCE/SEI, ASTM International, AWS, etc.
- Chapter 4 specifies the performance requirements for structural members and systems in terms of materials, design loads, structural systems and load paths, structural analysis, strength, serviceability, durability, sustainability, structural integrity, fire resistance, and specific types of construction.
- Chapter 5 specifies the load factors and combinations used in design.
- Chapter 6 specifies the methods of analysis, modeling of members and systems, and calculation of load effects. It covers simplified method for nonprestressed continuous beams and one-way slabs, first-order analysis with moment magnification method for slenderness effects and moment redistribution, elastic second-order analysis with P-delta effects, inelastic second-order analysis with material nonlinearity effects, and acceptability of finite element analysis.

The remaining chapters cover specific topics such as one-way slabs (Chapter 7), two-way slabs (Chapter 8), beams (Chapter 9), columns (Chapter 10), walls (Chapter 11), diaphragms (Chapter 12), foundations (Chapter 13), plain concrete (Chapter 14), prestressed concrete (Chapter 15), composite concrete flexural members (Chapter 16), anchoring to concrete (Chapter 17), reinforcement details (Chapter 18), strength reduction factors (Chapter 19), serviceability requirements (Chapter 20), durability requirements (Chapter 21), strut-and-tie models (Chapter 22), seismic design (Chapter 23), shotcrete (Chapter 24), and alternative design methods (Chapter 25).
