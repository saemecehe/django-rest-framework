Ni Vision Builder for Automated Inspection (VBAI) is a powerful software tool that allows you to create and deploy machine vision applications without programming. VBAI can help you automate tasks such as quality control, defect detection, measurement, and identification. One of the common applications of VBAI is crack detection, which involves finding and quantifying cracks on various surfaces and materials.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use VBAI to create a crack detection application that can run on a PC or an embedded system. We will also share some tips and best practices for optimizing your crack detection performance and accuracy.

## What You Need
 
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:
 
- A PC with Windows 10 and Ni Vision Builder for Automated Inspection 2020 or later installed. You can download a free trial version of VBAI from [here](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/software/products/vision-builder-for-automated-inspection.html).
- A camera that is compatible with VBAI. You can use any camera that supports the GigE Vision, USB3 Vision, or Camera Link standards. For this tutorial, we will use a Basler ace 2 GigE camera with a resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels and a frame rate of 30 fps.
- A lens that matches your camera and your inspection object. For this tutorial, we will use a 16 mm lens with a working distance of about 30 cm.
- A lighting source that provides sufficient illumination and contrast for your inspection object. For this tutorial, we will use a ring light with white LEDs.
- An inspection object that has cracks or potential cracks on its surface. For this tutorial, we will use a ceramic tile with artificial cracks.
- A network cable or a USB cable to connect your camera to your PC.
- A power supply for your camera and your lighting source.

## Step 1: Connect Your Hardware
 
The first step is to connect your hardware components as shown in the following diagram:

## Step 2: Launch VBAI and Create a New Inspection
 
The next step is to launch VBAI and create a new inspection. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open VBAI from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut.
2. Click on the New Inspection button on the toolbar or select File > New Inspection from the menu.
3. In the New Inspection dialog box, enter a name for your inspection, such as "Crack Detection", and click OK.
4. In the Configure Acquisition dialog box, select your camera from the list of available devices and click OK.

You should see a live image from your camera in the VBAI workspace. You can adjust the camera settings such as exposure time, gain, and white balance using the Camera Settings panel on the right side of the workspace.
 
## Step 3: Adjust Your Lighting and Focus
 
The next step is to adjust your lighting and focus to ensure that your inspection object is clearly visible and has enough contrast for crack detection. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Place your inspection object under the camera and align it with the center of the image.
2. Adjust the position and angle of your lighting source to minimize glare and shadows on your inspection object. You can use the Histogram panel on the right side of the workspace to monitor the brightness distribution of your image.
3. Adjust the focus of your lens until your inspection object is sharp and in focus. You can use the Focus Score panel on the right side of the workspace to measure the 8cf37b1e13
