## Step 2: Create a Profile and Scan Your Face
 
Before you can start animating, you need to create a profile and scan your face. A profile is a set of data that contains information about your facial features and expressions. A scan is a process of capturing your face in different poses and emotions. To create a profile, you need to open Faceshift Studio 1301 Win X64 and select the Data Workspace option. Then, you need to click on the New Profile button and enter your name and gender. To scan your face, you need to click on the Scan button and follow the instructions on the screen. You will be asked to make various facial expressions, such as neutral, smile, angry, sad, etc. The software will then create a 3D model of your face based on the scans.
 
## Step 3: Record Your Facial Animation
 
Once you have created a profile and scanned your face, you can start recording your facial animation. To record your facial animation, you need to select the Record Workspace option. Then, you need to choose a character model that you want to animate. You can use the default models provided by the software or import your own models from other programs. To import your own models, you need to make sure they are rigged with bones and blendshapes that match the Faceshift Studio 1301 Win X64 format. To start recording, you need to click on the Record button and perform your facial expressions in front of the sensor. The software will then capture your facial movements and apply them to the character model in real time. You can also adjust the settings and parameters of the recording, such as the frame rate, the smoothing, the calibration, etc.
 
## Step 4: Export Your Facial Animation
 
After you have recorded your facial animation, you can export it to use it in other programs or platforms. To export your facial animation, you need to select the Export Workspace option. Then, you need to choose a format that suits your needs. You can export your facial animation as a video file, an image sequence, a CSV file, or an FBX file. A video file is a simple way to view your animation on any device or player. An image sequence is a series of images that show each frame of your animation. A CSV file is a text file that contains numerical data about your animation, such as the coordinates of each point on your face. An FBX file is a binary file that contains both the geometry and the animation data of your character model. You can use an FBX file to import your animation into other 3D software or game engines.
