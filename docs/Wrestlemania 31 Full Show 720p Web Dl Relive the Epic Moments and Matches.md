## Highlights of Wrestlemania 31
  
Wrestlemania 31 was widely praised by critics and fans alike as one of the best Wrestlemania events ever. It featured a mix of exciting matches, surprising outcomes, and unforgettable moments. Here are some of the highlights of Wrestlemania 31:
  
- The main event between Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was a brutal and intense battle that saw both men deliver their signature moves and kick out of each other's finishers. The match ended in a shocking twist when Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and pinned Reigns after hitting him with a Curb Stomp, becoming the first person to cash in at Wrestlemania and the new champion.
- The appearance of Ronda Rousey and The Rock was one of the most electrifying moments of Wrestlemania 31. The two celebrities came to the aid of The Rock after he was confronted by Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in a segment that mocked his Hollywood career. Rousey showed off her MMA skills by tossing Triple H out of the ring and putting Stephanie in an armbar, while The Rock delivered a Rock Bottom and a People's Elbow to Triple H.
- The match between Sting and Triple H was a dream match for many wrestling fans, as it marked Sting's first and only WWE match after decades of being a WCW icon. The match was a nostalgic trip that featured several interferences from DX and nWo members, as well as a cameo from Shawn Michaels. The match ended with Triple H hitting Sting with a sledgehammer and pinning him, but both men shook hands afterwards in a sign of respect.
- The Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match was a thrilling opener that saw seven superstars compete for the title that was stolen by Bad News Barrett. The match featured several high-risk spots and near-falls, such as Daniel Bryan headbutting Dolph Ziggler off the ladder, Dean Ambrose crashing through a ladder after being powerbombed by Luke Harper, Stardust bringing out his own glittery ladder, and R-Truth hiding under the ring. The match ended with Bryan retrieving the title after knocking Ziggler off the ladder, becoming a two-time Intercontinental Champion.
- The Undertaker returned to Wrestlemania after losing his undefeated streak to Brock Lesnar at Wrestlemania 30. He faced Bray Wyatt, who had been taunting him for weeks with cryptic promos and supernatural antics. The match was a classic battle between two dark characters, with Wyatt trying to prove himself as the new face of fear and The Undertaker showing that he still had some gas left in the tank. The match ended with The Undertaker hitting Wyatt with a Tombstone Piledriver and pinning him, restoring his mystique and legacy.
