Here are the steps to install the driver:
 
1. Download the appropriate zip file for your operating system from [this link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/18508/intel-processor-i-o-controller-driver-for-windows-8-1-for-intel-nuc.html). The file name should be PROC\_IO\_Win8.1\_32\_603.9600.1948.32979.zip for 32-bit systems or PROC\_IO\_Win8.1\_64\_603.9600.1948.32979.zip for 64-bit systems.
2. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer.
3. Open Device Manager and locate the devices that have a yellow exclamation mark next to them. These are the devices that need the driver.
4. Right-click on each device and select Update Driver Software.
5. Select Browse my computer for driver software and navigate to the folder where you extracted the zip file.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
7. Restart your computer if prompted.

You should now have the IntelÂ® Processor I/O Controller Driver installed on your IntelÂ® NUC and be able to use the features it enables.
