# How to Bypass the Free Zone Limitations in Trackmania Nations Forever
 
Trackmania Nations Forever (TMNF) is a popular racing game that offers a free-to-play version with some restrictions. One of these restrictions is the Free Zone, which limits the players to only play on official Nadeo servers and prevents them from joining custom servers or playing user-made tracks. This can be frustrating for players who want to enjoy the full potential of the game and its community.
 
Fortunately, there are some ways to bypass the Free Zone limitations and play on any server or track you want. In this article, we will show you two methods that you can use to hack the Free Zone and enjoy TMNF without any restrictions.

## Method 1: Using TMUnlimiter
 
TMUnlimiter is a tool that patches the game and adds new functionality to the track editor. It allows you to create and play tracks with blockmixing, oversized maps, cross-environment mixing, custom blocks, scripts, and more. It also lets you avoid clips for blocks, which means you can place blocks anywhere without collision issues.
 
But TMUnlimiter also has another feature that can help you bypass the Free Zone: it allows you to change the car parameters, such as speed, acceleration, grip, and gravity. By changing these parameters, you can trick the game into thinking that you are playing on an official server, even if you are not. This way, you can join any custom server or play any user-made track without being kicked out by the Free Zone.
 
To use TMUnlimiter, you need to have TMNF version 2.11.26 installed. You can download TMUnlimiter from [this link](https://tmnf.exchange/threadshow/6517627). You also need to download the [TMForever.exe Steam Fix](https://github.com/copymark/TM-Trainer) if you are playing on Steam. Follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://tmnf.exchange/threadshow/6517627) to install and use TMUnlimiter.

To use Start Hack, you need to have TMNF version 2.11.26 installed. You can download Start Hack from [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y14BB2mlKAg). Follow the instructions in the video to install and use Start Hack.
 
## Conclusion
 
Trackmania Nations Forever is a fun and addictive racing game that offers a lot of content and features for free. However, some players may feel limited by the Free Zone restrictions that prevent them from playing on custom servers or tracks. By using TMUnlimiter or Start Hack, you can bypass these limitations and enjoy TMNF without any restrictions.
 
However, please note that these methods are not officially supported by Nadeo or Ubisoft, and may violate their terms of service or cause compatibility issues with future updates. Use them at your own risk and discretion.
