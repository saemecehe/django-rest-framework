## Step 1: Prepare Your Image
  
Before you run the action, you need to prepare your image. Make sure it is between 1500 and 5000 pixels in size and has a good contrast and sharpness. You can use any image you like, but portraits and landscapes work especially well with this action.
  
Open your image in Photoshop and create a new layer on top of it. Name it "brush" and fill it with white. This layer will be used to define the area where you want the action to apply.

## Step 2: Brush the Area
  
Select the brush tool and choose a soft round brush with black color. Adjust the size and opacity of the brush according to your preference. Then, start brushing over the area where you want the action to work. You don't have to be very precise, just cover the main parts of your subject.
  
You can also use different brushes or colors to create different effects. For example, you can use a textured brush or a gradient brush to add some variation to your strokes. You can also use different colors to create different layers of effects later.
  
## Step 3: Run the Action
  
Once you are happy with your brushing, it's time to run the action. Go to the actions panel and load the Artista action file. You will see four different actions: Artista - Mixed Media Art (Main), Artista - Mixed Media Art (Style 1), Artista - Mixed Media Art (Style 2), and Artista - Mixed Media Art (Style 3).
  
The main action is the one that creates all the graphic elements and effects. The other three actions are optional and apply different styles to your image. You can run them after the main action to change the look of your artwork.
  
To run the main action, select it and click on the play button at the bottom of the actions panel. The action will take a few minutes to complete, depending on your image size and computer speed. During this time, do not touch anything or interrupt the process.
  
## Step 4: Customize Your Artwork
  
When the action is done, you will see a lot of layers and groups in your layers panel. Each layer and group has a name and a color code that indicates its function and effect. You can turn on or off any layer or group to see what it does.
  
You can also edit any layer or group to change its settings, such as opacity, blend mode, color, filter, mask, etc. You can also move, scale, rotate, or duplicate any layer or group to create different compositions.
  
The best way to customize your artwork is to experiment with different combinations and settings until you find something you like. There is no right or wrong way to do it, just have fun and be creative!
  
## Step 5: Apply a Style (Optional)
  
If you want to change the overall style of your artwork, you can run one of the three style actions that come with Artista. These actions apply different color schemes and effects to your image.
  
To run a style action, select it and click on the play button at the bottom of the actions panel. The action will take a few seconds to complete and will create a new group on top of your layers panel with the name of the style.
  
You can turn on or off this group to see how
