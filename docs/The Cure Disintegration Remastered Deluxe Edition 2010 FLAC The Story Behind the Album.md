# The Cure's Disintegration: A Masterpiece Revisited
 
One of the most acclaimed albums of all time, *Disintegration* by The Cure, celebrates its 30th anniversary with a remastered deluxe edition that features the original album, a bonus disc of rare demos and outtakes, and a live concert from 1989. The new edition showcases the band's dark and atmospheric sound in stunning quality, and offers a glimpse into the creative process behind this masterpiece.
 
*Disintegration* was released in 1989 and marked a return to the gloomy and melancholic style that The Cure had pioneered in the early 80s. The album was a commercial and critical success, selling over three million copies worldwide and spawning several hit singles, such as "Lovesong", "Lullaby", "Fascination Street" and "Pictures of You". The album is widely regarded as one of the best albums of the 80s and one of the greatest albums of all time.

The remastered deluxe edition of *Disintegration* was supervised by The Cure's frontman and main songwriter Robert Smith, who also wrote new liner notes for the release. The remastering process aimed to enhance the clarity and depth of the original recordings, while preserving their warmth and character. The bonus disc features 20 tracks that were recorded during the *Disintegration* sessions, but were either left unfinished or unreleased. Some of these tracks are instrumental versions, alternate mixes or early demos of songs that made it to the album, while others are completely new songs that have never been heard before. The live disc captures The Cure's performance at Wembley Arena in London on July 22, 1989, during their world tour in support of *Disintegration*. The concert features 20 songs from the album and other classics from their catalogue.
 
The remastered deluxe edition of *Disintegration* is a must-have for any fan of The Cure or anyone who appreciates great music. It is a rare opportunity to revisit one of the most influential and timeless albums ever made, and to discover new facets of its beauty and brilliance.

The album also received rave reviews from critics, who praised its emotional depth, musical sophistication and lyrical maturity. Some even hailed it as the best album of the decade, or one of the best albums ever made. Pitchfork gave it a perfect 10 score and wrote: "The Cureâs 1989 album, released during what was arguably the bandâs peak period, receives a lavish reissue with some terrific bonus material. The late 1980s and early 90s were the Cureâs heydayâfrom an American perspective. Itâs not just that they were making great music; theyâd been making great music for roughly a decade already. But these were the years during which they coalesced into this whole iconic thing, the Cureâa sound, a look, and a sensibility that a few kids in every other high school could build whole identities around."
 
However, not everyone was impressed by Disintegration. Some fans felt that the album was too long, too slow and too depressing, and missed the more upbeat and diverse songs of Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me. Some critics also found fault with the album's production, which they considered too polished and bombastic, or with Smith's vocals, which they deemed too whiny and melodramatic. The Guardian gave a mixed review of the album's 30th anniversary live performance and wrote: "Despite its best efforts, the band cannot mask the fact that the original record has its fair share of flaws. Though not, you would have to say, for lack of trying by Robert Smithâs current lineup of longtime bassist and tattooed man of action Simon Gallup, drummer Jason Cooper, keyboardist Roger OâDonnell, and relative new boy of seven years, guitarist Reeves Gabrels."
 
Regardless of these criticisms, Disintegration remains a landmark album in The Cure's discography and in rock history. It is an album that captures the essence of Smith's vision and personality, as well as the mood and spirit of a generation. It is an album that transcends its genre and time, and speaks to universal themes of love, loss, despair and hope. It is an album that deserves to be celebrated and rediscovered by new and old fans alike.
