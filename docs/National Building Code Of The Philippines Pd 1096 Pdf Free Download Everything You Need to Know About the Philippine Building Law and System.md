The NBCP aims to safeguard life, health, property, and public welfare, as well as to promote sound environmental management and control. It covers all public and private buildings and structures, except traditional indigenous family dwellings. It also provides for the administration and enforcement of the code by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and local building officials.
  
If you are planning to build or renovate a building or structure in the Philippines, you need to comply with the NBCP and its implementing rules and regulations (IRR). You also need to obtain the necessary permits and certificates from the authorities before you start your project.
  
One of the requirements for obtaining a building permit is to submit a set of plans and specifications that conform to the NBCP and its IRR. These include architectural, structural, electrical, mechanical, sanitary, plumbing, fire protection, and accessibility plans.
  
To help you prepare your plans and specifications, you can download a free copy of the NBCP and its IRR from the official website of the DPWH. You can also find other useful information and resources on the site, such as the schedule of fees and other charges, the NBC forms, legal opinions, and related laws.
  
The NBCP and its IRR are also available in PDF format from other online sources. However, you should always check the validity and accuracy of these sources before using them. You should also consult with a licensed architect or engineer who can guide you through the process of complying with the NBCP and its IRR.
  
The NBCP and its IRR are essential documents for anyone who wants to build or renovate a building or structure in the Philippines. By following them, you can ensure that your project is safe, functional, durable, and environmentally friendly.
