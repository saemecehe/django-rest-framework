## Tips and Tricks for Playing Clash of Clans on PC
 
Playing Clash of Clans on PC can give you an edge over your opponents, but you also need to know some tips and tricks to make the most of it. Here are some of them:
 
- Coordinate your attacks with your clanmates. Clan wars are a great way to earn loot and trophies, but you need to work as a team to win them. Communicate with your clanmates using the chat feature or a third-party app like Discord. Plan your attacks according to your strengths and weaknesses, and target the bases that you can get three stars on.
- Do not rush your town hall. One of the biggest mistakes that many players make is upgrading their town hall too quickly without maxing out their defenses, troops, and resources. This will make you vulnerable to stronger enemies and reduce your loot income. Always upgrade your town hall last, after you have upgraded everything else in your village.
- Don't worry too much about walls. Walls are important for protecting your buildings from ground troops, but they are also very expensive and time-consuming to upgrade. You do not need to max out your walls at every town hall level. Focus on upgrading your defensive buildings that can attack both ground and air troops, such as mortars, archer towers, cannons, etc.
- Always attack closer to the town hall. The town hall is the most important building in Clash of Clans, as it contains a lot of loot and trophies. If you destroy it, you will get at least one star and a bonus loot. Therefore, always try to attack from the side where the town hall is located, or use spells and troops that can reach it easily.
- Achieve achievements and clear obstacles. Achievements are a great way to earn gems, which are the premium currency in Clash of Clans. You can complete achievements by doing various tasks in the game, such as winning battles, collecting resources, donating troops, etc. You can also earn gems by clearing obstacles in your village, such as trees, rocks, bushes, etc.

These are some of the tips and tricks that can help you play Clash of Clans on PC better. Of course, there are many more things to learn and discover in this game, so keep playing and have fun!
