If you are looking for a way to use the GrandMA onPC software on a budget for your lighting setup, you might be wondering if you can output the signal to a USB interface such as an ENTTEC Open USB DMX. Unfortunately, the answer is no. The GrandMA onPC software requires MA hardware connected to unlock any universes. The cheapest hardware that would work would be an MA1 NSP if you can find one for a good price, which isn't easy.

However, there is another option that you can try: the dot2 software. The dot2 software is also developed by MA Lighting and it allows a single universe of Artnet output without any hardware. You can use the dot2 software with a USB to DMX adapter and control your physical lighting fixtures. The dot2 software is similar to the GrandMA onPC software in terms of philosophy, structure, and syntax. If you learn dot2 thoroughly, you are literally learning MA except with fewer options. Of course, MA is far more powerful and has more features, but dot2 gives you the ability to do quite a bit with a live rig while also learning MA.
 
To use the dot2 software with a USB to DMX adapter, you will need some finessing with third-party software. You can follow this tutorial on YouTube to see how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nH4XYVDqGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nH4XYVDqGI). Basically, you will need to install a virtual network adapter and a virtual DMX interface on your computer. Then, you will need to configure the dot2 software to output Artnet to the virtual network adapter and use the third-party software to convert Artnet to DMX and send it to your USB interface.
 
This might sound complicated, but it is actually quite simple once you get the hang of it. And it is a great way to use MA software on a budget and learn how to work with different consoles. If you have any questions or problems, you can check out the MA Lighting Forum or the r/lightingdesign subreddit for more help and advice.
  
So what are the features of the dot2 software that make it a good choice for learning MA? The dot2 software is easy to operate and provides on-board Help and Direct Hints to guide a new user to operate the console to its full potential[^1^]. A full range of clever programming and playback features provide intuitive access to advanced functionality. For example, you can use the Track & Shield function to control which parameters are stored in a cue and which are not. You can also use the powerful effects engine to create dynamic movements and changes for your fixtures.

The dot2 software is also available in multiple languages and supports Unicode characters, which makes it suitable for international users. You can switch between languages easily and even use different languages for different parts of the software. For example, you can use English for the command line and Chinese for the fixture names. The dot2 software also supports importing and exporting show files in different formats, such as MA2, MA3, CSV, and XML.
 
Another feature of the dot2 software is the integration with the dot2 3D visualization software. The dot2 3D software is a free of charge 3D visualizer that runs on a WindowsÂ® 7 or later PC. It allows you to create a realistic 3D model of your stage and lighting rig and see how your show looks like without any physical fixtures. You can connect the dot2 3D software with the dot2 onPC software via MA-Net2 or Artnet and control your virtual fixtures as if they were real. The dot2 3D software also supports importing 3D models from other programs, such as SketchUp or Blender.
