Assassin's Creed Rogue has received mixed reviews from critics and players alike. Some praised the game for its compelling story, its naval gameplay, and its exploration of the Templar perspective. Others criticized the game for its lack of innovation, its technical issues, and its recycled content from previous games.
 
According to OpenCritic, a website that aggregates reviews from various sources, Assassin's Creed Rogue has an average score of 74 out of 100 based on 57 reviews. The website also shows that 67% of the critics recommend the game, while 33% do not.
 
Some of the positive reviews include PC Gamer, which gave the game a score of 74 and said: "Assassin's Creed: Rogue is Black Flag with worse writing and (broadly) improved missions. Does very little to alter the formula, but is about as mechanically sound as Assassin's Creed gets and runs well on PC."[^2^]
 
Another positive review came from IGN, which gave the game a score of 8.0 and said: "Rogueâs greatest strength is its central character â Shay Patrick Cormac â and his journey from dutiful Assassin to vengeful Templar. Most of the trailers surrounding Rogue have portrayed Shay as a cold-blooded killer, but thatâs in no way accurate; his story is nuanced, and the narrative is patiently unfolded."[^1^]
 
Some of the negative reviews include Metacritic user TheGamerGuy16, who gave the game a score of 0 and said: "I disliked Assassin's Creed Rogue on almost every level, from its numerous game-breaking bugs, to its terrible free-running, and (worst of all) its ruined assassination system. Not even the plot, which fills in the gap between Black Flag and Assassin's Creed 3 while recounting the fall of the North American Brotherhood, is very satisfying."[^4^]
 
Another negative review came from GameSpot, which gave the game a score of 6.0 and said: "Assassin's Creed Rogue is an intriguing addition to the series, but it's not a significant departure from familiar territory. It presents an interesting take on the Templar-Assassin war by casting you as a traitor caught between both sides. But it doesn't capitalize on this potential as much as it could have."
