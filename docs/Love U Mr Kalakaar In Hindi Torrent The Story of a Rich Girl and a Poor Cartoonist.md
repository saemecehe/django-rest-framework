Rajshri Productions is a film production and distribution company based in Mumbai, India, that has been making Hindi films since 1947. The company is known for its family-oriented and traditional movies that often feature themes of love, friendship, and values. Some of its most successful films are Dosti (1964), Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), Hum Aapke Hain Kaun (1994), and Vivah (2006). However, in recent years, Rajshri Productions has failed to connect with the modern audience and has faced several box office flops. One of these flops is Love U Mr. Kalakaar (2011), which is the subject of this review.
  
Love U Mr. Kalakaar is a movie that tries to recreate the old-fashioned charm of Rajshri films, but ends up being a boring and outdated clichÃ©. The movie revolves around a rich girl (Amrita Rao) who falls in love with a poor cartoonist (Tusshar Kapoor), much to the dismay of her father (Ram Kapoor), who wants her to marry a successful businessman. The movie follows the predictable plot of the lovers trying to prove themselves to the father, who eventually softens up and accepts them.
  
The movie suffers from many flaws, such as weak script, poor direction, bland music, and mediocre performances. The script is full of unrealistic and superficial characters who have no depth or personality. The direction is lackluster and fails to create any excitement or emotion in the scenes. The music is forgettable and does not suit the mood or genre of the movie. The performances are uninspired and wooden, especially from Tusshar Kapoor, who plays the titular Mr. Kalakaar.

The movie also fails to capture the changing trends and tastes of the new-age audience, who are looking for more than just a simple love story. The movie does not address any contemporary issues or challenges that the young generation faces today. The movie relies on outdated stereotypes and values that do not resonate with the modern viewers. The movie does not offer any novelty or innovation in its presentation or execution.
  
In conclusion, Love U Mr. Kalakaar is a disappointing movie that does not live up to the legacy of Rajshri Productions. It is a movie that refuses to adapt or evolve with the times, and instead sticks to its old formula that has lost its relevance and appeal. It is a movie that shows that Rajshri Productions needs to reinvent itself and embrace the new styles and sensibilities of film-making if it wants to survive and succeed in the competitive industry.
